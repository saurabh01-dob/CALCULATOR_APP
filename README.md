Calculator GUI Application (Python)

This project is a simple Calculator GUI application built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator supports real-time input display, clear/reset functionality, and expression evaluation using Python’s built-in eval() function. The layout is fixed-size, well-organized using frames, and designed to resemble a standard calculator for easy usability.
